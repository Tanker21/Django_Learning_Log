# Django_Learning_Log
Django framework project for logging items

This is a project from the book, Python Crash Course, by Eric Matthes.  It is a Django project for creating logs on what users have learned, and allows users register new users, 
log out, see only their own topics and entries, and is public facing (through the use of Heroku).
